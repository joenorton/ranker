RANKER
by Joe Norton

Ranker is a tool for performing ELO-based matchmaking/comparisons between images.

I created and used this tool in a workflow pipeline I created while working on generative AI art projects and I needed to vet & grade/rank large amounts of images.

The way it works is you have your images in an accessible local area, ALERT: change the PATH in the docker-compose file to match your scenario, and then run it locally.

The local flask app will allow you to quickly and easy perform rank-based ordering.
